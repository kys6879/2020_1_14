    Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
    Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (yah)
    Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright)
    I was hot as hell up in the heat (yeah, yeah)
    Then this storm came in to save my life
    Meditate, just got down on my knees (straight up)
    Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night
    In the nighttime (woo, yeah)
    Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (rollin')
    Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (oh no)
    Niggas femalin', they excelling (yeah)
    Are they intelli'? (what you tellin'?)
    We propellin', up top with Ellen, uh (with the choppers)
    Kill the jealous with propane repellent
    Got me goin' crazy (it's lit)
    On tour, we'll tell 'em, we bought the section (gang)
    They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic like we projected
    So we cut the plug, he's interjected (got me goin' crazy)
    Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
    Whenever I'm down, it got me goin' crazy (yah)
    Psychedelics got me goin' crazy
    I was hot as hell up in the heat (yeah, yeah)
    Then this storm came in to save my life
    Meditate, just got down on my knees (straight up)
    Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night
    In the nighttime (woo, yeah)
    Got me goin' crazy
    Ok, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
    Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
    If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
    Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
    '99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
    Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
    Before no car note, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
    Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
    Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
    When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
    Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the lead
    And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
    I got 'em stage divin' out the nose bleeds
    And she hit that booger, sugar 'til her nose bleed
    Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
    She was talkin' 'bout forever got a whole week
    But she know my baby mama is a trophy
    She be throwing up them B's feel like we both bleed
    She keep my dick jumpin up, feel like I'm Moby
    I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe
    Yeah, this right here is astronomical
    I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
    They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
    They keep itching at my spit, I'm diabolical
    You feel me?
